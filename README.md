## OpenCode, without being tied to your laptop

## Quick Start

OpenCode Mobile is an independent, community-built mobile companion for [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/).

It connects to the OpenCode server you already run and gives you a focused mobile control surface for the moments when you need to check, guide, approve, or continue agent work away from your desk.

It is not trying to put a desktop IDE on a smaller screen.

It is designed around the things that actually matter on mobile.

## What you can do

- **Start and continue coding sessions**  
  Pick an agent and model, send instructions, and keep working with the same OpenCode sessions from your phone.

- **Watch agent progress**  
  See what OpenCode is doing instead of waiting for a generic completion notification.

- **Review and approve actions**  
  Respond to permission requests and inspect the work before accepting changes.

- **Manage workspaces and sessions**  
  Switch between multiple OpenCode servers, projects, sessions, and models.

- **Use the terminal when needed**  
  Run focused commands without reopening your laptop.

- **Browse and patch files**  
  Inspect project files and make targeted changes from mobile.

- **Use voice input**  
  Dictate prompts or continue a conversation when typing is inconvenient.

- **Understand model usage**  
  Inspect context utilization, token activity, model usage, steps, and estimated cost.

- **Stay connected to multiple servers**  
  Save OpenCode connections with their own sessions and model selection.

## How it works

Your code stays on the machine running OpenCode.

OpenCode Mobile connects to that server remotely:

```text
Your phone
    │
    │ HTTPS / secure tunnel
    ▼
OpenCode server
    │
    ▼
Your workspace + models
```

A typical setup looks like this:

### 1. Start OpenCode

```bash
opencode serve --port 4096
```

### 2. Expose it securely

Keep the server protected with authentication and connect through a secure HTTPS tunnel, VPN, or reverse proxy.

For example:

```bash
cloudflared tunnel --url localhost:4096
```

Tailscale, Cloudflare Tunnel, and other secure networking options work well.

### 3. Connect from OpenCode Mobile

Enter the protected server URL in the app, authenticate, choose your workspace, and continue your sessions.

For the complete setup flow, see the [Getting Started guide](https://getopencode.app/docs/getting-started/).

## Install

### Android

Recommended:

[**Download from Google Play →**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.getopencode)

Or install the latest APK directly:

[**Download latest APK →**](https://github.com/alvarolorentedev/opencode-mobile/releases/latest/download/opencode-mobile.apk)

### iOS

OpenCode Mobile is currently available through TestFlight:

[**Join the iOS beta →**](https://testflight.apple.com/join/ddcE5Wzz)

For installation details and requirements, visit:

[**getopencode.app/download →**](https://getopencode.app/download/)

## Privacy and control

OpenCode Mobile is designed around self-hosted OpenCode environments.

- Your source code remains on your OpenCode host.
- The app connects to infrastructure you control.
- Server credentials are stored using secure device storage where appropriate.
- You choose how your OpenCode instance is exposed.
- No hosted OpenCode server is required.

For remote access, prefer authenticated HTTPS, a VPN, or a secure tunnel rather than exposing an unauthenticated OpenCode port directly to the internet.

## Community-built

OpenCode Mobile is not an official OpenCode product.

It is an independent open-source project built for people who already use OpenCode and want to keep their agent workflows reachable when they step away from their desk.

OpenCode and its trademarks belong to their respective owners.

## Development

OpenCode Mobile is built with:

- React Native
- Expo
- TypeScript
- Expo Router
- OpenCode SDK/client

For local development, architecture, testing, and release instructions:
